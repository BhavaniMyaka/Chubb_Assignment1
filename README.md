This repository contains solutions for my Data Engineering lab exercises using the Pandas library.
It includes:

Creating DataFrames (CSV, lists, dicts)
Filtering & subsetting
Descriptive statistics and group operations
Data cleaning (missing values, duplicates, data types)
A complete ETL pipeline (CSV → Clean/Transform → JSON)

Extended pipeline for Exercise 6
Added profit calculation
Added discount logic
Added store-level summary export
Modularized ETL into reusable functions
Exported multiple outputs (clean JSON + summary JSON)
